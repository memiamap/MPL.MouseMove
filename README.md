# MouseMove

A tool that moves the mouse by a pixel at predefined intervals.

Handy for preventing activity tracking applications such as Microsoft Teams from marking you as Away automatically when you may be at your computer but not necessarily actively moving the mouse.

To use, run the MouseMove application.
